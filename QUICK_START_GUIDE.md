# Quick Start Guide
## Audience
This document supports two target audiences:
* Integrator  - Someone who is taking OB-USP-AGENT and integrating it into a device.
                Normally this also involves extending the data model to support the device.
* Contributor - Someone who is enhancing the core functionality of the open source OB-USP-AGENT implementation.


## Document conventions
When referring to source code functions, this document will often use 'XXX' to represent a set of possible function names.
For example,  DEVICE_XXX_Init() refers to a set of functions:
 * DEVICE_STOMP_Init()
 * DEVICE_MTP_Init()
 * DEVICE_CONTROLLER_Init()
 * etc


## Building OB-USP-AGENT
1. Install dependencies (Curl, OpenSSL, Sqlite, C-Ares, z-lib, autotools) using package manager:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libc-ares-dev libz-dev autoconf automake libtool
```

2. Install OB-USP-AGENT from source:
```
$ autoreconf --force --install
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```


## Running OB-USP-AGENT for the first time
Before OB-USP-AGENT starts, it needs a database containing the settings of the USP controller to contact.
This is known as the 'factory reset database'.
This database may be created using either:
* 'obuspa -c dbset' commands (see next section)
* code in vendor_factory_reset_example.c (if INCLUDE_PROGRAMMATIC_FACTORY_RESET is defined in vendor_defs.h)
* a text file located by the '-r' option
To start with, use the last option, as this is the simplest method.

If OB-USP-AGENT cannot find a database when it starts up, then it will create one using the parameter values specified in the file located by the '-r' option.

To specify the data model parameters and values used to create the factory reset database, modify factory_reset_example.txt. You will need to modify the STOMP connection parameters and the USP EndpointID of the controller to connect to.

To create the database and run OB-USP-AGENT connecting to a STOMP server from network interface eth0 with protocol and trace logging enabled to stdout, use the following command:
```
$ obuspa -p -v 4 -r factory_reset_example.txt -i eth0
```

If OB-USP-AGENT successfully connected to your STOMP server you should see trace like the following on stdout:

```
   Attempting to connect to host=controller1 (port=61613, unencrypted) from interface=eth0
   Connected to 127.0.0.1 (host=controller1, port=61613) from interface=eth0
   Sending STOMP frame to (host=controller1, port=61613)
   STOMP
   accept-version:1.2
   host:/
   heart-beat:30000,300000
   endpoint-id:os\c\c002456-0800270B57FF
   login:my_username
   passcode:
   
   
   Received CONNECTED frame from (host=controller1, port=61613)
   CONNECTED
   session:session-1K6NehQnoR3hioRXZgFBBw
   heart-beat:300000,30000
   server:RabbitMQ/3.5.7
   version:1.2
   
   
   Sending SUBSCRIBE frame to (host=controller1, port=61613)
   SUBSCRIBE
   id:0
   destination:/queue/agent-q1
   ack:auto
```

If OB-USP-AGENT failed to connect, review the settings in your factory reset database and the STOMP server.
If you subsequently change the settings in factory_reset_example.txt, then you must delete the database,
in order that the database is re-created the next time you run OB-USP_AGENT.
To delete the database in the default location:
```
$ rm /tmp/usp.db
```

Alternatively you can use the 'obuspa -c dbset' command (see next section) to alter parameters
in the database, and try again.

## CoAP Message Transfer Protocol
OB-USP-AGENT also supports CoAP MTP. As with STOMP MTP, this is enabled
by setting data model parameters in the relevant CoAP MTP data model objects.

**IMPORTANT**
When using CoAP over DTLS, OB-USP-AGENT must have a client certificate (e.g. using the '--authcert' option).


## OB-USP-AGENT Command Line Arguments
OB-USP-AGENT supports two modes, a daemon mode (seen above) and a command (or CLI) mode, which supports interactively
querying the data model and setting values in the database. The CLI mode is specified with the '-c' option.

* To see a list of arguments use:
```
$ obuspa --help
```

* To see a list of commands supported in CLI mode use:
```
$ obuspa -c help
```

* To see the currently implemented USP data model use:
```
$ obuspa -c show datamodel
```

* To see all data model parameters stored in the database:
```
$ obuspa -c show database
```

* To set the value of a data model parameter in the database use:
```
$ obuspa -c dbset "parameter" "value"
```
IMPORTANT: This command must only be run when there is no daemon instance of OB-USP-AGENT running,
as it directly alters the value in the database without notifying a running daemon of the change.

* To set the value of a data model parameter when the daemon is running use:
```
$ obuspa -c set "parameter" "value"
```

* To query the value of a parameter when the daemon is running use:
```
$ obuspa -c get "parameter"
```

The "parameter" may contain USP search expressions and partial paths.
For example, to query the value of all parameters in the DeviceInfo object when the daemon is running use:
```
$ obuspa -c get "Device.DeviceInfo."
```

The CLI mode also supports adding and deleting instances of data model objects and running USP commands.

## OB-USP-AGENT Source Tree
The /src directory contains the following sub-directories:
* core       - This implements the core functionality and data model of OB-USP-AGENT.
               Contributors will make code changes in this directory.

* vendor     - This contains code which is intended to be modified by an integrator.
               Integrators extend the data model and core functionality registering vendor hooks (callbacks).

* include    - This defines the publically accessible APIs exported to integrators (USP and VENDOR APIs).
               Contributors may make changes to files in this directory. Integrators must not.

* libjson    - This contains an open source Javascript Object Notation implementation.
               Neither contributors or integrators are likely to need to modify this code.

* protobuf-c - This contains pre-generated code implementing the USP record and USP message protobuf schemas.
               Contributors will only need to re-generate this code if the USP protobuf schema changes.


## OB-USP-AGENT APIs
Two APIs are of interest to an integrator. They are declared in the src/include directory.

* VENDOR API - An integrator must implement this API by modifying the stub functions in the src/vendor directory

* USP API - An integrator makes calls to this API to register the data model and notify OB-USP-AGENT core of changes

For information on the purpose and arguments of an API function, consult the function header comments
where the function is defined (typically src/core/usp_register.c or src/core/usp_api.c).


## OB-USP-AGENT Build Defines
The file src/vendor/vendor_defs.h contains feature switch defines and various other compile time defines.
The following defines are most likely to need modifying:


* DEFAULT_WAN_IFNAME - Name of the network interface to be used for USP communications.

* CONNECT_ONLY_OVER_WAN_INTERFACE - If defined only the network interface specified in DEFAULT_WAN_IFNAME is
                                    used for USP communications. If not defined, the Linux routing tables select
                                    which network interface to use.
                                    IMPORTANT: Even if not defined, DEFAULT_WAN_IFNAME must be a valid network interface.
                                    
* DEFAULT_DATABASE_FILE - The file system location of the database file, if none is specified
                          by the '-f' option when invoking OB-USP-AGENT.

* CLI_UNIX_DOMAIN_FILE - The file system location of a unix domain stream file used for communication
                         between OB-USP-AGENT running in CLI and daemon modes.

* VENDOR_OUI - The value of Device.DeviceInfo.ManufacturerOUI. This may be overridden by a value in the database.

* VENDOR_PRODUCT_CLASS - The value of Device.DeviceInfo.ProductClass
* VENDOR_MANUFACTURER - The value of Device.DeviceInfo.Manufacturer
* VENDOR_MODEL_NAME - The value of Device.DeviceInfo.ModelName


## Extending the Data Model
Use the USP_REGISTER_XXX() set of functions to register USP data model objects, parameters, cammands and Events.
* Integrators should always call USP_REGISTER_XXX() from VENDOR_Init() in src/vendor/vendor.c
* Contributors should create a new device_XXX.c file in src/core, and call USP_REGISTER_XX() from a 
  DEVICE_XXX_Init() located in the new device_XXX.c file.
  The new DEVICE_XXX_Init() must be hooked into the existing core data model from DATA_MODEL_Init() (in src/core/data_model.c).

Example (for Integrators):

```C
int VENDOR_Init(void)
{
    return USP_REGISTER_VendorParam_ReadOnly("Device.DeviceInfo.ModelNumber", GetModelNumber, DM_STRING);
}

int GetModelNumber(dm_req_t *req, char *buf, int len)
{
    strncpy(buf, "MyModelNumber", len);
    return USP_ERR_OK;
}
```

This example registers the Device.DeviceInfo.ModelNumber parameter.
The Get_ModelNumber() vendor hook function is called whenever OB-USP-AGENT core needs to get the value of the parameter.

The error codes to return are defined in src/include/usp_err_codes.h.
If an error occurs, call USP_ERR_SetMessage() to set an error message that will be returned by the USP protocol.

For more complex examples of extending the data model, see the DEVICE_XXX_Init() functions in the src/core/device_XXX.c files

IMPORTANT:
At bootup, the instance numbers of data model objects must be signalled to OB-USP-AGENT core using USP_DM_InformInstance().
* Integrators should call USP_DM_InformInstance() from VENDOR_Start() (in src/vendor/vendor.c).
* Contributors should call USP_DM_InformInstance() from a DEVICE_XXX_Start() function in their device_XXX.c file.

After bootup, changes to object instances should be signalled with the USP_SIGNAL_ObjectAdded() and 
USP_SIGNAL_ObjectDeleted() functions.

For an example of implementing a USP asynchronous command, see src/core/device_selftest_example.c.

USP data model events are registered by USP_REGISTER_Event() and USP_REGISTER_EventArguments().
They are signalled with USP_SIGNAL_DataModelEvent().
Use the USP_ARG_XXX() functions to create the event's argument list.


## Overriding the Core Implementation
The core implementation of OB-USP-AGENT has defaults for many aspects of functionality.
Some aspects have been designed to be overridden by the integrator using callbacks.
To override the default implementation, register a core vendor hook callback by calling
USP_REGISTER_CoreVendorHooks() from VENDOR_Init() (in src/vendor/vendor.c).

Example (for Integrators):

```C
int VENDOR_Init(void)
{
	vendor_hook_cb_t core_callbacks;
	memset(&core_callbacks, 0, sizeof(core_callbacks));
	core_callbacks.get_mtp_password_cb = GetStompPassword;
	return USP_REGISTER_CoreVendorHooks(&core_callbacks);
}

int GetStompPassword(char *buf, int len)
{
	strncpy(buf, "MyPassword", len);
	return USP_ERR_OK;
}
```

The example registers a callback to get the STOMP MTP password.
Other vendor hook callbacks may be registered by setting the relevant callback in the
core_callbacks structure, before calling USP_REGISTER_CoreVendorHooks().

The typedefs for each of the core vendor hook callbacks are declared in src/include/usp_api.h.

The following core vendor hooks are most likely to need overriding:
* reboot_cb - called by OB-USP-AGENT core to reboot the device after receiving a Device.Reboot() command
* factory_reset_cb - called by OB-USP-AGENT core to perform a factory reset after receiving a Device.FactoryReset() command
* get_trust_store_cb - called by OB-USP-AGENT core to get the list of SSL certificates to install in OB-USP-AGENT's trust store. These can alternatively be specified using the '-t' option when invoking OB-USP-AGENT.
* get_agent_cert_cb - called by OB-USP-AGENT core to get the SSL client certificate and private key associated with this device. This can alternatively be specified using the '-a' option when invoking OB-USP-AGENT.

Certificates provided to the get_trust_store_cb() and get_agent_cert_cb() must be in DER (binary) form.
